Here is a short list of my projects:

<h2>tmpc</h2>
<p>This is a tiny mpd client written in Qt. The aim is to allow to quickly find some songs to add to the current playlist and to close it afterwards.</p>

<p>The main goal of this project is to have a low memory footprint and to be quick to open and close.</p>

<h2>yggdrasil</h2>
<p>This is an ancient project I've recently digged from an old hard drive. Basically, this was an RPG engine. It was rewritten multiple times, this version is actually the fourth or fifth.</p>


<h2>webcam_led</h2>
<p>I never use my webcam, but I'd like to use its LED to notify me of some things. That's the purpose of webcam_led.</p>

<p>This will open the video device and activate the minimum functions to turn the light on. When the LED is off, everything is turned off. I use it with another project to be quickly notified of incoming mails.</p>

<h2>qimaptray</h2>
<p>On my netbook, I don't want to have a big appliance to read mails like kmail. I still like to have a tray icon that tells me how unread mails I currently have in my INBOX.</p>

<p>This is what this does. It's also optionnallyplugged with webcam_led so that it notifies of unread mails by turning on the webcam LED.</p>

<h2>desco</h2>
<p>I have a raspberry PI that I'd like to plug in my car or on my bike to play music. This is meant to be an mpd client with some other basic UI elements.</p>

<p>As I want that raspberry to boot really fast, I don't want to use Xorg, and for now, I've taken the route of a custom framebuffer-based display.</p>

<h2>agos</h2>
<p>I often like to remember about 15 years ago, when I read the few documentation I had to write some assembly code and wrote a minimal OS.</p>

<p>Since there isn't really a practical use of writing another general purpose OS nowadays, and I still want to tweak things in Assembly, I began this project of creating a few small games that can be both booted (from a floppy or USB disk) and ran from a real OS.</p>

<p>The games themselves are not fixed yet, but for now I've begun to write support for the display handling.</p>
